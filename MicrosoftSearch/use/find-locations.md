# Find locations

Search for buildings, offices, campuses, and more to see a map result and address. You can easily get directions and see what's nearby on Bing Maps.
  
1. Sign in to your work or school account on Bing
    
2. Search for the location name
    
    For example, 'Building 9' or 'West Cafe.'
    
3. A map appears at the top of the results page showing the location and the street address
    
    Other web results appear under it. They aren't specific to your organization.
