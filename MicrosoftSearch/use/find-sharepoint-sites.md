# Find SharePoint sites

Search for SharePoint sites you own or look for ones created by groups or co-workers that you have access to. You'll see site results on Bing, but not individual pages within a site. SharePoint site results include the site name and location.
  
1. Sign in to your work or school account on Bing
    
2. Search for a site name or topic
    
3. Site result appears at the top of the results page
    
    To only see site results, click the **Sites** tab. 
    
Web results appear under your work results. They aren't specific to your organization.
