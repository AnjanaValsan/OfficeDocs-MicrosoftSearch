# Add a location

Add a location and when your users search they'll see the address of the building, office, or place and its location on a map. They can also use Bing Maps to get directions, see what's nearby, and more.
  
1. Go to the Microsoft Search in Bing Admin portal
    
2. In the navigation pane, click **Locations**
    
3. At the top of the page, click **Add location**
    
    The Edit location page appears, with an interactive map.
    
4. Choose a **Country/Region**
    
5. Enter the **Address**
    
    You'll see a location indicator on the map for the address. This is the map users will see when they search for this location.
    
6. If needed, enter any **Suite/Unit/Floor** information 
    
7. Enter a **Location name**
    
    Describe this location the way your users typically refer to it. For example, a building name or number. Don't repeat the address.
    
8. Enter **Keywords** you want to trigger this location 
    
    Include words or phrases people will use to find this location or areas within it, for example: Headquarters, Building 9, or West Cafe.
    
9. Enter **Reserved keywords**
    
    Use one or more reserved keywords to ensure that a location always appears as the most relevant result. Reserved keywords can't be shared across locations.
