Microsoft Graph Connectors are a preview feature and are subject to the same terms of use described under “Previews” in the [Online Services Terms](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/Downloader.aspx?documenttype=OST&lang=English).

Your use of Microsoft Graph Connectors may be subject to third party terms and conditions. Microsoft is not a party to your agreement(s) with third parties and any concerns or questions regarding third party terms or services should be directed to the third party. You, as the data controller for your data, are responsible for the indexing of data into your Microsoft 365 tenant. 

Microsoft makes no representation, warranty, or guarantee in relation to the third party data prior to indexing into your Microsoft 365 tenant.  Microsoft assumes no liability for errors that may occur during the indexing of third party data.  You agree that any data sourced from a third party provider is provided “as is,” and with respect to the index, is provided subject to your configuration. Indexed data in your Microsoft 365 tenant will be considered “Customer Data” for purposes of the [Online Services Terms](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/Downloader.aspx?documenttype=OST&lang=English), [Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement), and Microsoft’s other data obligations.
