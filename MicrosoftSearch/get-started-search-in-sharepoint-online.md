# Get started with Microsoft Search in SharePoint Online
Microsoft Search is the modern search experience in SharePoint Online. SharePoint Online also offers a classic search experience. As a search administrator you can’t turn on or off neither the modern nor the classic search experience. They are both on by default. Which search experience your users get depends on where they search from:

- Users get the Microsoft Search box on the SharePoint home page, hub sites, communication sites, and modern team sites. 
- Users get the classic search box on publishing sites, classic team sites, and in the Search Center.

Follow these steps to get your organization started with Microsoft Search in SharePoint Online: 
## Step 1: Get your organization to adopt Microsoft Search 
Influence your organization to start using modern sites instead of classic sites. [Learn about the modern experience in SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/SharePoint-classic-and-modern-experiences-5725c103-505d-4a6e-9350-300d3ec7d73f).
## Step 2: Promote searching from the SharePoint home page 
Teach your users to search from the app they’re already working in when they need to find something instead of going to the classic Search Center. If they work in an app that doesn’t have a Microsoft Search box yet, guide them to use their [SharePoint home page](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx), their [Office 365 home page](http://office.com/), or [Bing](https://bing.com
) as their starting point for searching. Consider hiding your classic Search Center from users.

## Step 3: Import promoted results from classic search to Microsoft Search 
If your organization has already defined promoted results in the classic search experience to help users find information quickly, then promoted results that were defined at the tenant level are candidates for import to Microsoft Search. In Microsoft Search promoted results are known as bookmarks.
