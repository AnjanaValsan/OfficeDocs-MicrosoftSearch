# Get started with Microsoft Search in SharePoint

Microsoft Search in SharePoint is the modern search experience in SharePoint Online. SharePoint Online also offers a classic search experience, . As a search administrator you canâ€™t turn on or off either of these search experiences. They are both on by default. Which search experience your users get depends on where they search from:

- Users get the Microsoft Search box on the SharePoint start page, hub sites, communication sites, and modern team sites.
- Users get the classic search box on publishing sites, classic team sites, and in the Search Center.

Follow these steps to get your organization going with Microsoft Search in SharePoint:

## Step 1: Prepare for Microsoft Search in SharePoint

Users can only find SharePoint content that's been indexed. Microsoft Search uses the same index for SharePoint content as classic search does, and SharePoint content is crawled and indexed automatically. 
If your organization will use both classic search and Microsoft Search in SharePoint, [learn how to avoid impact from classic search settings on Microsoft Search in SharePoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/differences-classic-modern-search).

Follow the guidelines to [set up Microsoft Search](set-up-microsoft-search.md) in general.


## Step 2: Get your organization to adopt modern sites

Influence your organization to start using modern sites instead of classic sites. [Learn about the modern experience in SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/SharePoint-classic-and-modern-experiences-5725c103-505d-4a6e-9350-300d3ec7d73f).

## Step 3: Promote searching from the SharePoint start page

Teach your users to search from the SharePoint start page instead of from the classic Search Center. Consider hiding your classic Search Center from users.
