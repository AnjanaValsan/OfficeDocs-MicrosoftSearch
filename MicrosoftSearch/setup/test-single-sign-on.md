# Test single sign-on

Single sign-on reduces the number of times users are prompted to sign in. Testing single sign-on with a small group of users will help identify any blocking configuration issues. 
  
For Chrome users on Windows 10, single sign-on will only work if the Windows 10 and AAD sign-in extension for Chrome is installed. 
  
## Download the Windows 10 and AAD sign-in extension for Chrome

We recommend that you create a group policy to automatically install this extension.
  
1. Go to the Microsoft Search in Bing Admin portal
    
2. In the navigation pane, click **Tools**
    
3. In the Tools list, download the **Windows 10 and AAD sign-in extension for Chrome**
    
4. Share the extension with Chrome users on Windows 10
