# Set up Microsoft Search

As part of Office 365, Microsoft Search in Bing is easily deployed by enabling Bing from the Office 365 admin center. Once enabled, a quick configuration to set a logo, name, and color and give users access is all that's needed to get set up. From there, authorized users can sign in to Bing with a work or school account and get work results when they search.
