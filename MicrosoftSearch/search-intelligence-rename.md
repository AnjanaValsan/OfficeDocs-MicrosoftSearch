# Search & Intelligence

Microsoft Search administration is currently found in the  [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) under **Settings** > **[Microsoft Search](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch).** We are renaming the navigation to Search & Intelligence. This change will start to rollout to customers on October 1, 2020 and reach all customers in a matter of weeks.

## Why we are making this change

Microsoft Search makes your organization more productive by helping people find what they need, fast. As we continue to improve and evolve Microsoft Search, we are intersecting with functions that go beyond information discovery to areas like knowledge management, task completion, privacy controls and more.
What we have learned from working with customers, is that the people doing the administration across these areas is the same person, in most cases.

One of our core principles is to organize administration around people and experiences, not technology. This, combined with a set of admin controls that will span experiences has brought us here.

The future starts with this rename to Search & Intelligence which will be followed over the coming weeks, months, and beyond to include knowledge management and more.

## No change in the brand

Microsoft Search is here to stay and is the product that brings you enterprise search. The name change in the navigation just enables the future.
