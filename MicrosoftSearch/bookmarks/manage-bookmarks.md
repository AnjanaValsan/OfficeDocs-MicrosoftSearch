# Manage bookmarks

Over time, you may need to update a bookmark's status and content to keep it relevant. 
  
## Filter bookmarks

Use the filter option in the upper-right corner of the Bookmarks page to find bookmarks by date and who modified them. For example, set the date slider to 30 days and select an admin or editor to see the list of bookmarks they've created or changed in that time.
  
## Change bookmark content or settings

1. Go to the Microsoft Search in Bing Admin portal
    
2. In the navigation pane, click **Bookmarks**
    
3. To find a bookmark, search, filter, or click a bookmark status to narrow your results
    
4. To change or update a bookmark, click the title
    
5. Make any changes or updates to the content or settings and preview how they'll appear 
    
6. Click **Save**
    
## Bulk export and edit bookmarks

Never edit data in these fields:
  
- Id
    
- Last Modified
    
- Last Modified By
    
Id is a unique identifier for each bookmark and should never be edited. The Last Modified and Last Modified By fields should only be used to sort and find bookmarks.
  
1. If you want to export a subset of your bookmarks, filter them
    
2. In the upper-right corner of the Bookmarks page, click **Export**
    
3. Save or open the .csv file

  - Keywords
    
  - State
    
  - Description
    
  - Reserved Keywords
    
  - Start Date
    
  - End Date
    
  - Country/Region
    
  - Groups
    
  - Device&amp;OS
    
  - Targeted Variations
    
5. Save the .csv file
    
6. In the upper-right corner of the Bookmarks page, click **Import**
