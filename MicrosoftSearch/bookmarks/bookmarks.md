# Bookmarks

Start your article with a very short introduction (1 sentence). Put yourself in the reader's place - why are they here? What should they do? 
  
1. Get straight to a quick list of steps to accomplish the task.
    
    If you need to explain a concept, or they have to do pre-requisite steps, add a quick summary below the step where they need it, and [link](https://support.office.com/article/f37e7984-cf03-4fde-92d3-82970d7e241b.aspx) to the concept or steps. 
    
2. Keep procedures short - preferably 5 or fewer steps, no more than 8.
    
3. Use **Ui style** for user interface elements or for text people need to enter. 
    
4. Use the verbs choose, select, or enter as actions, and format menus as **Menu** \> **Command**.
    
5. Optionally, add a screenshot for context (if UI is hard to locate, or it's needed to complete the task).
    
    Maximum width: 520 pixels. Use a standard theme, do not show any personal information, and crop to show only what's relevant. 
    
    ![Placeholder - maximum width for SOC article art is 520 pixels](../media/7d43d3be-8658-4a5b-aa15-ed62a47a2b24.png)
  
If you want to add a video or screenshot, use a two-column grid and have the steps in the left and the video or screenshot in the right - see [Steps and video grid example](https://support.office.com/article/14ce8e82-efa0-47f5-bb84-94f078db3dae.aspx). 
  
Target no more than 500 words for an article.
