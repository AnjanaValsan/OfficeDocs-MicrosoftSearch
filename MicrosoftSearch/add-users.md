# Manage users

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Search in Bing settings are now available in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Get started by [assigning search admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftsearch/setup-microsoft-search#step-2-assign-search-admin-and-search-editor) in your admin center.

Editors can add content, but can't change settings
  
## Add admins and editors

1. Go to the Microsoft Search Admin portal
    
2. In the navigation pane, click **Users &amp; permissions**
    
3. At the top of the page, click **Add admin or editor**
    
4. In the **Additional admins** box, search for the people or groups you want to give admin permissions and select them from the results 
    
5. In the **Editors** box, search for the people or groups you want to give editor permissions and select them from the results 
    
6. Click **Save**
    
## Add users

By default, Microsoft Search is available to everyone in your organization. To modify access, use [conditional access in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview).
