## Intent
Take from "Quick set-up" focusing on what to do, not the UI steps. 

Reuse some "Content settings", "Security", "Requirements",  "Connected services", "Add user", "Test single sign-on"

Add some info from the Advanced DNS configuration topic. We'll link to the authoritative IP Addresses & URLs content.
