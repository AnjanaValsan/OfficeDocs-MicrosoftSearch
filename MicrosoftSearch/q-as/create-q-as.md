# Create Q&amp;As

Q&amp;As provide an answer or info to users including an optional link. Ideally, a Q&amp;A includes all the details your users are looking for so they don't need to go to the source. You can format your Q&amp;A content and include images, lists, and tables.
  
## Create a Q&amp;A

For information about creating effective titles, descriptions, keywords, and more, see [Planning your content.](../setup/plan-your-content.md)
  
1. Go to the Microsoft Search in Bing Admin portal
    
2. In the navigation pane, click **Q&amp;As**
    
3. At the top of the page, click **Add Q&amp;A**
    
    The Edit Q&amp;A page appears, with a preview of how the Q&amp;A will look on Bing. As you add the required information, the preview will automatically update.
    
4. Enter a **Title**
    
    The title is the heading that appears in the result. It can be up to 120 characters long and we recommend using a question format.
    
5. If needed, enter the **URL** of the page, site, or location the bookmark will link to 
    
    This lets users that need additional information easily get to the source to read more.
    
6. Enter an **Answer description**
    
    This should answer the question that's asked in the title. You can copy existing HTML content and paste it here. Any unsupported tags will be ignored.
    
7. Use HTML tags and the built-in options to format text, add images, lists, tables, and more
    
    Use the preview at the top of the page to see how your tags and formatting will appear on Bing. For information about:
    
  - HTML tags, see the Supported HTML tags list below
    
  - Built-in options, click **Markdown guide** (question mark icon) 
    
8. Enter **Keywords** you want to trigger this Q&amp;A 
    
    Like a bookmark, when a user searches for any of the keywords you've included, this Q&amp;A will be included in their work results. Try adding as many variants as possible, including the title of the Q&amp;A.
    
9. Select **Automatically match similar keywords** to expand your set of keywords 
    
    This enables a broader matching of search terms and helps ensure this Q&amp;A is included in relevant work results.
    
10. Enter **Reserved keywords**
    
    If a keyword triggers multiple Q&amp;As, Microsoft Search in Bing will place the most popular one at the top and show the others as related links. Use one or more reserved keywords to ensure a Q&amp;A always appears as the top result. Reserved keywords can't be shared across Q&amp;As. Also, sharing reserved keywords across Q&amp;As and bookmarks isn't recommended. If a bookmark and a Q&amp;A share a keyword or a reserved keyword, the bookmark will always take precedence and the Q&amp;A will not appear.
    
## Add Q&amp;A settings

Q&amp;A settings give you additional control over when a Q&amp;A appears and who sees it.
  
- Dates
    
    Set a start date as well as an optional end date to control when a Q&amp;A will be published or expire.
    
- Country/region
    
    If you select countries or regions, only users in those locations will see that Q&amp;A.
    
- Groups
    
    Use the Groups setting to make a Q&amp;A result available only to members of a selected group. For example, if you're creating Q&amp;As that pertain only to employees in the HR department, you could map this setting to the appropriate HR security group.
    
- Device &amp; OS
    
    If you select device types or operating systems, only users searching on those devices or using those systems will see that Q&amp;A.
    
- Targeted variations
    
    Use this setting to vary the content of the Q&amp;A based on a user's device and location.
    
## Use a browser extension to create content

From the Tools section of the Admin portal, download and install the Content creator browser extension for Edge or Chrome. To use the extension, sign in and go to a site or page that you want to add as a Q&amp;A. Review and change the suggested content, including keywords, add any additional content, and save the Q&amp;A.
  
If multiple Q&amp;As are found, review each one and determine whether you want to publish, save to draft, or save all to draft.

You can use existing HTML content or add HTML tags to your answer description. Unsupported tags are ignored.
  
- blockquote
    
- div
    
- em
    
- h1, h2, h3, and h4
