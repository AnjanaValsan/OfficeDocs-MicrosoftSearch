# Create and manage Q&amp;As

## Create Q&amp;As

Q&amp;As provide the best possible answer for your user's work-related questions. Users can easily discover them when they enter keywords you've associated with them on Bing.
  
- [Create Q&amp;As](create-q-as.md)
    
    Add individual Q&amp;As.
    
- [Bulk create and import Q&amp;As](bulk-create-q-as.md)
    
    Create Q&amp;As in a .csv file and bulk import them.
    
## Manage Q&amp;As

Use the Q&amp;A status, filtering tools, and bulk export/import tools to [find and update Q&amp;A content](manage-q-as.md), including title, answer, keywords, and URLs.
  
## Q&amp;A status

In the Admin portal, you can view Q&amp;As by their current status:
  
- Published
    
    Published Q&amp;As appear in Bing search results when an authorized user searches for a keyword.
    
- Draft
    
    If a Q&amp;A isn't ready to publish, save it as a draft. Draft Q&amp;As will not appear on Bing.
    
- Scheduled
    
    Scheduled Q&amp;As are automatically published on a future date.
    
- Expired
    
    Expired Q&amp;As were automatically removed from published content based on the expiration date.
    
- Suggested
    
    Suggested Q&amp;As are based on feedback from users.
