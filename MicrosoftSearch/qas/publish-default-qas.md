# Publish default Q&As

To easily see how Q&As appear on Bing, search for your default published Q&As or publish the default suggested Q&As. Also, use them as a reference to understand how to name Q&As and create good keywords.
  
We suggest you review the two sets of default Q&As:
  
- Default published Q&As
    
    These include results with answers to common questions about Microsoft Search.
    
  - For new tenants, they're automatically published when Microsoft Search is enabled in the Microsoft 365 admin center. You can edit or delete them at any time.
    
  - For existing tenants, they're added to the list of suggested Q&As
    
- Default suggested Q&As
    
    These include results for common work-related searches, like paid holidays, social media policy, 401K matching, and family leave policies.
    
If we find an existing Q&A with the same title or URL as a default Q&A, the default will be discarded. We won't modify the existing Q&A in any way, publish the default Q&A, or include the default Q&A in the Suggested list.
  
## Update and publish a default suggested Q&A

1. Go to the Microsoft Search Admin portal
    
2. In the navigation pane, click **Q&As**
    
3. On the Q&Aspage, click **Suggested**
    
4. Selected a suggested Q&A and click **Edit**
    
5. Review the Q&A content and make any necessary edits
    
6. Add missing information, such as a URL or description
    
7. Click **Publish**
    
Currently, default Q&As are only available in English.
