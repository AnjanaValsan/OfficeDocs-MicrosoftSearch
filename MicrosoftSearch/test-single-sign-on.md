# Test single sign-on

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Search in Bing settings are now available in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Get started by [assigning search admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftsearch/setup-microsoft-search#step-2-assign-search-admin-and-search-editor) in your admin center.
    
Single sign-on reduces the number of times users are prompted to sign in. Testing single sign-on with a small group of users will help identify any blocking configuration issues. 
  
For Chrome users on Windows 10, single sign-on will only work if the Windows 10 and AAD sign-in extension for Chrome is installed. 
  
## Download the Windows 10 and AAD sign-in extension for Chrome

3. In the Tools list, download the **Windows 10 and AAD sign-in extension for Chrome**
