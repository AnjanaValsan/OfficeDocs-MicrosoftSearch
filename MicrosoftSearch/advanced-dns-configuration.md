# Advanced DNS configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article applies to the Microsoft Search in Bing admin portal. Weâ€™re moving the portal to the Microsoft 365 admin center, and then it will be removed. We recommend that you use the Microsoft 365 admin center to get started. [Overview of Microsoft Search](overview-microsoft-search.md).
    
To ensure Bing can always identify users within your organization and successfully sign them in to their work or school account, configure your internal DNS server or proxy server to resolve from `www.bing.com` to `ms.bing.com`. To do this, create a DNS entry for `www.bing.com` to be a CNAME for `ms.bing.com`.
  
****

|**Name**|**Type**|**Value**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|`www.bing.com`  <br/> |CNAME  <br/> |`ms.bing.com`  <br/> |
   
Using a CNAME rather than the IP address is preferred since a CNAME will continue to work if the IP address changes. After you make this DNS change, results will continue to appear to your users as if they are coming from `www.bing.com`. 
  
This requires no additional configuration on client machines and provides a seamless experience for your users. When they go to `bing.com`, they'll be automatically signed in more consistently, and if they can't be signed in automatically, they'll be prompted to do so.
