# Microsoft Search Insights dashboard reports

You can use the Microsoft Search insights dashboard to manage your published answers. This is just one of the steps needed to [make content easy to find](make-content-easy-to-find.md) for your users.

When you first go to Microsoft Search in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you'll enter on the Insights dashboard.

Here are the reports that are available on the insights dashboard.

## Query volume (Queries, clicks, and click-through rate)

The most prominent report on the page is the Query volume report. This report displays the number of search queries users perform over time. With Query volume, you can identify search query volume trends and determine days or months of high and low search activity.

## Top queries

This report gives details about the top 2000 search queries that users run. For a query to appear in Top queries, the query must get at least three clicks.

The click-through rate (CTR) is calculated as `(searches that result in a click in the search engine results page [SERP]) / (total searches for this query text) * 100`. A low CTR means that users aren’t finding what they’re looking for.

## No results queries

This report shows the 1000 most popular search queries that returned no results. With **No Results queries**, Microsoft Search admins can identify search queries that might create user dissatisfaction.

That information can help you make content more discoverable by adding bookmarks, Q&A, and other components that improve search accuracy.

## Abandoned queries

This report shows the 1000 most popular search queries that received "no click-through". Queries that aren’t clicked after 30 minutes are considered abandoned.

Abandoned queries indicates that the user didn't find what they needed and with **Abandoned queries**, you can identify search queries that might create user dissatisfaction.

## Impression distribution

This report shows impression distribution over time for various answers. Examples are bookmarks, people, Q&A, files, locations, file sites, groups, and conversations. 

Impression Distribution can help admins understand what users look for during a specified period.
