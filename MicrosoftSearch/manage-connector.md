# Manage Microsoft Graph Connectors in the M365 Admin portal

In order to get access to manage your connectors, you must be designated as a search administrator for your tenant. If you are not a search administrator, you must contact your tenant administrator to provision you for this role.

To navigate to the connectors management portal, do the following:
1.	Sign into the admin portal: https://admin.microsoft.com.
2.	Go to **Settings** > **Microsoft Search** > **Connectors**. 

The following operations are supported in the Microsoft 365 admin portal for each connector type:

**Operations** | **Microsoft built-in connector** | **Partner connector** | **Custom-built connector**
